Upload Roblox files from python

# Note:
The [rbxUpload.py](https://github.com/Roblox-Thot/Roblox-Uploader/blob/main/import%20vers/rbxUpload.py) should work but I didn't test it so it could just not work

# Requires:
Any map file type
<!--[scrub.py](https://github.com/h0nde/roblox-game-scrubber) in the same folder
(only needed for uploading .rbxlx maps)-->
